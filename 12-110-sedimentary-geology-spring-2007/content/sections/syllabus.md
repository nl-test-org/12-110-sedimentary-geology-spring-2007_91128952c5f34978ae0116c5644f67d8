Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 2 hours / session

Prerequisite
------------

Introduction to Geology (12.001)

Description
-----------

Survey of the important aspects of modern sediments and ancient sedimentary rocks. Emphasis is on fundamental materials, features, and processes. Textures of siliciclastic sediments and sedimentary rocks: particle size, particle shape, and particle packing. Mechanics of sediment transport. Survey of siliciclastic sedimentary rocks: sandstones, conglomerates, and shales. Carbonate sediments and sedimentary rocks; cherts; evaporites. Siliciclastic and carbonate diagenesis. Paleontology, with special reference to fossils in sedimentary rocks. Modern and ancient depositional environments. Stratigraphy. Sedimentary basins. Fossil fuels: coal, petroleum.

Calendar
--------

Two 2 hour lectures per week for the first half of the term: 16 lectures.

During the eight weeks, at each lecture students are given a list of three or four questions, on which to supply brief written answers, based on lectures and lecture notes, to be due at the time of the following lecture.

Lec #17: Non-graded group oral examination

Lec #18-25: Laboratory work on sediments and sedimentary rocks

Field Trip: Four full days in the field in southern Nevada and southern California

Final five weeks of the term: Students prepare field reports

Grading
-------

There are no graded examinations. The grade is based entirely upon the quality and completeness of the field report.
